This is Cops and Robbers game in C language.
There are several restrictions:
1.	The maximum board sizes are 30X30; and the minimum size of board is 5X5.
2.	Only in case of one cop, if the sum of the positions of the cop (row +col), and the robber position (row + cop) are even, then the robber wins automatically.
3.	The robber cannot move if he reaches to the borders of the board. 

Comments: 
1. The robber moves automatically. 
2. The user is responsible for moving the cops in the board. 
3. In each turn the cop moves one position up/down/left/right (if one of the cops is on the border of the board, less possible movements will be presented).
4. If the position of the cop is equal to the one of the rob the cop wins.
