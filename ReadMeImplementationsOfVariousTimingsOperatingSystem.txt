It this code, I implemented in Python language, implementations of various timings, such as, FCFS, LCFS Non- Preemptive, LCFS Preemptive, Round Robin, and SJF. 
For each timing, I calculated the mean turnaround of the processes.  

Comments: 
1.	Every input document is a list of processes. The first row in the document is the number of processes that need to be executed. 
2.	From the second row onwards, every row constitutes a new process that includes two numbers in syntax of "number, number". The first number represents the clock cycle that the process is arrive to the operation system; the second number represents the amount of the clock cycles that the process needs CPU unit. 
3.	In order to run the code, go to the Terminal in Python, and write 
"\main.py .\input1.txt". 
*input1 can be changed as you desire as long as there is a text file in the same name in the folder of the project.
