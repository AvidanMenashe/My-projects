this code creates a  xor net to predict the vaules of a xor between two bits.
if the result is 1 the code should present a value that is close to one.
if the result is 0 the code should present a vaule that is close to minus one.
in the main fucntion we do the train function until we found a weights to the paramater of the net that give as loss value that is smaller than 0.15.
